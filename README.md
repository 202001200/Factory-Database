# Factory-Database
 This repository contains the code and documentation for a full-scale factory application relational database. The database has been developed using DBMS concepts and is designed to meet the specific requirements of factory applications.
The database solution is designed to deliver high performance and can easily scale to accommodate future growth and expansion.

## Components:

### Requirements Gathering: 
Extensive effort was made to gather the requirements of the factory application, ensuring that the database meets the desired functionality and performance goals.
### Software Requirements Specification (SRS): 
A detailed SRS document was created, outlining the specifications and scope of the project.
### Noun Analysis: 
A thorough noun analysis was performed to identify the entities and relationships within the factory application domain.
### Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams: 
ER diagrams were designed to visualize and represent the relationships between different entities in the database.
### Relational Models:
The relational models were carefully designed, considering the requirements and the relationships identified in the ER diagrams.
### Normalization Techniques: 
Implementation of normalization techniques ensures optimal data integrity and reduces redundancy in the database.
### Documentation: 
The entire development process has been thoroughly documented, providing clear instructions for seamless integration and scalability.
